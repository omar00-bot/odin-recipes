    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Filipino Mom taught me how to make this traditional dish following the recipe her mother taught her. And
        though I've made a couple of changes, I guarantee they're Mom-approved. 'Lolah' is 'Grandma' in the Philippines,
        in case you were wondering. Serve over steamed rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickling spice, wrapped in cheesecloth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering. Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds. Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. Do not brown.</li>
        <li>Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice. Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.</li>
    </ol>
